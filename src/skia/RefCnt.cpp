    :py:class:`RefCntBase` is the base class for objects that may be shared by
    multiple objects.

    When an existing owner wants to share a reference, it calls ref(). When an
    owner wants to release its reference, it calls unref(). When the shared
    object's reference count goes to zero as the result of an unref() call, its
    (virtual) destructor is called. It is an error for the destructor to be
    called explicitly (or via the object going out of scope on the stack or
    calling delete) if getRefCnt() > 1.
